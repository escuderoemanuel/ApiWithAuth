# API (Practice Project)
***
### This project focuses on functionality, with a basic user interface.


**This Repository has several branches, which are divided as follows::**

- **Branch 'CRUD':** Contains the methods necessary to Create, Read, Update and Delete. That can only be accessed by a user who has logged in before.
- **Branch 'DataBase':** The data base will use CRUD methods to store. 
- **Branch 'CSV':** Will export the database to a CSV file.
